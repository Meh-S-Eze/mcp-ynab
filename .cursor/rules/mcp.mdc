# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Repo Help

This repository houses an MCP server that interfaces with You Need A Budget (YNAB).  How to build an MCP server is documented below:

- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt (or [llms-full.txt](mdc:docs/llms-full.txt))
- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk (or @mcp-py-sdk.md )

Use the references when creating new resources, tools, or other components, and reference the Python SDK when trying to understand how to use SDK primitives.
