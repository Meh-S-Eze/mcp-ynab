# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Help

There are some docs to help composing an MCP-compliant server:

- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt
- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk

You can also use [llms-full.txt](mdc:docs/llms-full.txt) and [mcp-py-sdk.md](mdc:docs/mcp-py-sdk.md) to reference how to implement features of the Python version of the MCP protocol.
